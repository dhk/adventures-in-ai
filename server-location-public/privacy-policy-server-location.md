# Privacy Policy for Server Location Finder Extension

Last updated: 2024-August-28

## 1. Introduction

This privacy policy explains how the Server Location Finder Extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles data when you use our Chrome extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## 2. Information We Process

Our extension processes the following information:

- The URL of the website you are currently visiting
- The IP address of the server hosting the website you are visiting

It's important to note that while we process this information to provide our service, we do not collect, store, or retain any of this data. All this information is kept in your browswer and we have no access to it.

## 3. How We Use Information

The extension uses the current website's URL to query a third-party API (ip-api.com) about the physical location of the website's server. This process happens in real-time and solely within your browser.

## 4. Data Sharing and Transfer

We do not collect, store, or transfer any personal data. The only data transfer that occurs is the API request to ip-api.com, which includes the IP address of the website you're visiting. Please refer to ip-api.com's privacy policy for information on how they handle this data.

## 5. Your Rights and Choices

Since we do not collect or store any personal data, there is no personal information for you to access, modify, or delete. You can uninstall the extension at any time to stop all data processing.

## 6. Security

We've designed our extension with privacy in mind. By not collecting or storing any data, we minimize security risks associated with data breaches or unauthorized access.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Our extension is not directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly process data from children.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
