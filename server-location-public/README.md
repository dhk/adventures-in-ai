# Experiments in AI: Google-worthy code
The original project is [found here](../server-location/README.md) and offers a browswer-bar popup showing you the server location of a page you're currently on.

I decided to go full-circle; and see if I could get this code published as a Chrome Store extension

Caveats
* I had to used [imresizer.com](https://imresizer.com/) to create the correctly sized icons
* I had to ask Claude to change the manifest version from V.2 to V.3. This is probably beause the version changed since Claude last Learned
* I expect push-back from Google about the permissions. Claude didn't seem to have a definitive answer on what was needed, and why

Stay tuned!
