Idle curiosities and experiments with AI tooling.

The initial focus is on
* how AI-based tools support analytics exploration.
* whether and how to incorporate these toosl into analyst workflows
* how these tools help with training
* how AI tooling changes the prodcut discovery & definition process

Along the way I'll include working code examples, because argument without evidence veers towards opinion.

## Projects
* evaluating "The Greatest Democracy in the World" on a number of different dimensions [link here](greatest-democracy/README.md)
* creating a browswer-extension to identify the location of a web server
* thinking about how RFM can be applied to a variety of use cases beyond the traditional customer segmentation
* using wordcloud to let you see similarities & differences between
    * your LinkedIn profile
    * your resume
    * the job description

## To Do:

* Turn the Projects list into a table
    * what's problem statement
    * inks to code
    * ationale for using AI
    * iscoveries & observations along the way
