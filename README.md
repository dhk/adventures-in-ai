## Is the US The Greatest Democracy in the World
This is a tongue-in-cheek analysis of comparing 8 nations each of whom is somehow a democracy comparable to the USA.

The idea is to see how each nation scores compared the USA. 

The motivation for this was twofold
* a line from a recent political speech
* my desire to see how well claude/colab/github would play together 

Disclaimer:
1. there's no verification of input data
2. enjoy at your own risk
3. MIT license for you to take and adapt as you see fit. 
4. the weighting algorithms are truly scary. 

Observations
1. Claude does a good job of generating very journeyman code
2. whenever you're looking at an analysis that claims to be weighted, or be representative of a population, make sure you undesrtand the basis of that weighting.
3. Bias is everywhere
