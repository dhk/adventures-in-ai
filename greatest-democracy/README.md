# Is the US The Greatest Democracy in the World
This is a tongue-in-cheek analysis of comparing 8 nations each of whom is somehow a democracy comparable to the USA.

The idea is to see how each nation scores compared the USA.

The motivation for this was twofold
* a line from a recent political speech
* my desire to see how well claude/colab/github would play together

## Summary
* [the summary of findings](democracy-metrics-analysis-summary.md) the answers Claude came up with
the [claude conversation log](user-instructions-summary.md). What I typed in to get to the results
* various `*.ipynb` files - the code that Claude generated for Collab notebook
## Disclaimers
1. there's no verification of input data
2. enjoy at your own risk
3. MIT license for you to take and adapt as you see fit.
4. the weighting algorithms are truly scary.

## Observations
1. Claude does a good job of generating very journeyman code
2. whenever you're looking at an analysis that claims to be weighted, or be representative of a population, make sure you undesrtand the basis of that weighting.
3. Bias is everywhere (lol)
4. there's a non-trivial use case here: gather some real world data and fashion it for me


## To-Dos
[] Covert the code to ordinary python+pandas; add commits to track evolution
