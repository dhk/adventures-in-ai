# Democracy Metrics Analysis

## Overview

This document summarizes an analysis of various metrics for democratic countries, with a focus on creating weighted rankings that can be adjusted to prioritize different countries. We've created two main versions of the analysis: one optimized to rank New Zealand first, and another optimized to rank the United States first.

## Data and Metrics

We analyzed the following countries:
1. United Kingdom
2. Germany
3. Canada
4. Australia
5. India
6. Brazil
7. France
8. USA
9. New Zealand

The metrics used in our analysis include:
- Population
- Armed Forces (total and as a percentage of population)
- Incarcerated population (total and as a percentage of population)
- GDP (total and per capita)
- Average Income
- Poverty Rate
- Billionaire Wealth
- Financial Fairness Metric

## Methodology

1. We created a pandas DataFrame with the raw data for each country.
2. Derived metrics were calculated (e.g., Armed Forces %, GDP per capita).
3. Countries were ranked for each metric.
4. A weighting system was implemented to calculate an overall score.
5. An algorithm was developed to adjust weights iteratively until the desired country (New Zealand or USA) ranked first.

## Code Structure

The core of our analysis is contained in a Python script. Here's a high-level overview of its structure:

1. Data import and initial calculations
2. Definition of metrics and their properties
3. Ranking calculation for each metric
4. Weight adjustment function
5. Iterative process to optimize weights
6. Visualization of results
7. Output of rankings and weights

## Results

### New Zealand Optimized Ranking

When optimized for New Zealand to be ranked first, the most influential factors were:

1. Incarceration (total and percentage)
2. Poverty Rate
3. Billionaire Wealth
4. Financial Fairness Metric

### USA Optimized Ranking

When optimized for the USA to be ranked first, the most influential factors were:

1. Total GDP
2. Size of Armed Forces
3. Population
4. Average Income

## Key Findings

1. The ranking system is highly sensitive to the weighting of different metrics.
2. Smaller countries like New Zealand can be prioritized by emphasizing per-capita metrics and measures of equality.
3. Larger countries like the USA can be prioritized by emphasizing absolute numbers in areas like GDP and military size.
4. The same set of data can produce dramatically different rankings depending on which aspects are emphasized.

## Reproducibility

To reproduce this analysis:

1. Ensure you have Python installed with the following libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy.
2. Copy the provided code into a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python script).
3. Run the code, modifying the target country as desired.
4. The code will output rankings, weights, and a visualization of the results.

## Limitations and Future Work

1. The data used is static and may not reflect the most current values. Regular updates would be needed for ongoing analysis.
2. The weight adjustment algorithm is relatively simple and could be refined for more nuanced analysis.
3. Additional metrics could be incorporated for a more comprehensive analysis of democratic countries.
4. The definition of what makes a country "better" is subjective and reflected in the weighting system. Different stakeholders might prioritize different metrics.

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates the power and limitations of weighted ranking systems. By adjusting weights, we can dramatically change the outcome of country rankings. This highlights the importance of transparency in ranking methodologies and the need for careful consideration of which metrics are prioritized in international comparisons.
