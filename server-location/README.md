# What does this do?
Provides a Chrome browswer-extension that shows you the location of the web server that your page is currently pointing at

# What's this all about?
I wanted to experience the process of generating an app in a language & framework with which I'm unfamiliar. I've never created a browswer extension before although I've used JavaScript extensively in the past.

I've saved the [conversation transcript here](server-location-chat.MD)

# Observations
1. Based on cursory inspection, the code seems correct.
2. The hardest part of this was splitting the generated code up into the correct files (and that's no big lift, for sure)
3. (And this is based on some other work as well)AI-assisted code generation makes it possible to prototype product features that work -- the idea is that I can show people wireframes or I can give people scrappy-apps with which to interact. This seems like a significant change in feature discovery.

# Want to discuss?
Sure. I love to talk about stuff.
