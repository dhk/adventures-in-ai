# About spam-texter
My glorious vision is that when spambots reach out to my via text, my computers respond
Things I'm thinking about
1. Teaching it to learn, to keep the spambots engaged for as long as possible
1. having different personae - 
  - "Unhinged" is a good one
  - little old lady in Springfield, OH
  - a nigerian spammer (yup - see if we can't convince them they're talking to one another)
  - ..
1. Somehow figure out how to hook it up to my phone so it can take over the appropriate conversations (!) 

  You get the the idea 

  ## How to do this
  I don't really know. But my partner nn crime is chatgpt. I'll post bits of the transcript along the way so that you can see how I'm doing it

  ## Major bits so far
  1. I need twilio so that I can have a POTS (Plain Old Telephone Network) phone # that can receive and send messages
  1. software server behind it, that will host the actual code that's doing the work
  1. 


  ## Things I want
  1. I want to be able to watch the conversation.

  ## Along the way
  - [ ]For local testing, I have to figure out how to make a client app that mimics sending text messages
  - [ ] I need some sort of conversational chatbot to actually answer the inbound
