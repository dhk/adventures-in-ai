# Situation: Asking LLMs to answer the question `how many Rs in the word "strawberry"` gives a variety of inconsistent answers.

## Background
This investigation takes inspiration from [this article](https://hammadulhaq.medium.com/the-curious-case-of-spelling-strawberry-401cb7d5b100) and I draw some conclusions and offer advice to tech & business leaders.

It seems a very straightforward question:
>how many Rs in the word "strawberry"

Your answer should be 0 or 3. It's zero if you insist that the letter "R" is different from the letter "r"

However, and contrary to ordinary expectations, LLMs give us varying answers of 1, 2 and 3


## Key Takeaways
- LLMs, like all programming tools, are better and worse suited to particular use cases. Do not use them for cases where reproducibility & precision is required
- The technology is still in its infancy, but progressing rapidly
- The quality of the answers is directly influenced by the availability of relevant information
- Product, Engineering and Analytics teams who are using LLMs must build QA and verification processes around them
