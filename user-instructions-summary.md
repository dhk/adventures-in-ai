# User Instructions for Democracy Metrics Analysis

This document chronologically lists the instructions and requests provided during the development of the Democracy Metrics Analysis project.

1. "Please create some python/pandas code that visualizes data on a number of different dimensions, creating stack ranked charts."

2. "I'm comparing various countries that are all democracies but ranking them on different metrics. Here are the countries in no particular order:
   1. United Kingdom
   2. Germany
   3. Canada
   4. Australia
   5. India
   6. Brazil
   7. France
   1. USA"

3. "So, please do three things:
   1. find the populations of each of the countries based on total # of people, total people in the armed forces and total # of people who are currently incarcerated
   2. do the same thing but for # of armed forces and # of currently incarcerated, please do it as a % of total population
   3. create the best visualization to compare them
   And do all this in python with pandas"

4. "It should start by reading in the names of different countries; the metric/definition that's being decided and the value that it represents. With that, I want to be able to chart the stack ranked list of each of these countries against the scoring of the metric."

5. "Please customize the code for google colab."

6. "Please add two new visualizations:
   1. what's the GDP of each country
   2. what's the GDP/person of each country
   3. what's the average income per person per country"

7. "Please add New Zealand to the mix, calculate all the statistics again and this time show where new zealand ends up compared to the rest - e.g. it might be #7 in terms of Financial Fairness and #9 compared to armed services."

8. "Please create another stack ranked chart. This time, I want you to take the stack rankings of each country on each dimension and merge them together, so we get an overall rank, per country for all dimensions. Treat each dimension as having a stack-rank weighting of one, although I want to be able to adjust that later."

9. "Also, the poverty rate metric: lower poverty = higher score. And, finally, skip the stuff about downloading files. I don't need that."

10. "Please change the code so that it's 'Billionaire Wealth' rather than 'Billionaire Wealth (billion USD)'."

11. "Please regenerate the code from scratch, re-organizing the data so that it's all added at once, rather than incrementally. Just print out the nz composite stack rankings and the scoring used."

12. "New Zealand is not yet #1. Canada is. Please fix this."

13. "Please display those final rankings as a stack ranked chart."

14. "Please make those weights as a CSV."

15. "Please create another version of this code, but this time stack rank the US into the #1 spot, with weighting."

16. "When the US is rated #1, what were the weights; and please put them in order according to the value of the weight."

17. "Show me the same answers but for NZ being number 1."

18. "Please create a markdown file of this chat so that I can store it in github for other people to understand and reproduce my work."

19. "Please create another file of the instructions that I gave you."

These instructions showcase the evolution of the project from a simple visualization task to a complex analysis with multiple countries, metrics, and weighting systems. They also highlight the iterative nature of the development process, with frequent adjustments and additions to the analysis based on interim results.
